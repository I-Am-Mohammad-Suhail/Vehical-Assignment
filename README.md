# Vehicle Registration Analytics Dashboard (Vahan Data)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a simple **backend + dashboard** that analyzes Indian vehicle registration data (sourced from the **Vahan Dashboard**).  
It provides insights into:
- Vehicle type-wise registrations (2W, 3W, 4W)
- Manufacturer-wise market share
- Growth trends (Year-over-Year and Quarter-over-Quarter)

The goal is to present this from an **investorâ€™s perspective** â€“ highlighting which vehicle categories and manufacturers are growing fastest.
